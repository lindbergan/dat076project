//In order to communicate with the DB you'll need to do the following preparations:

// ...create a schema in MySQL Workbench with the name "webshop"
// ...create a user that can access that database that has the username: 'root' and password 'admin'

// ...Also - note that at the moment we re-create the tables when we run the backends app.js (that means all edits will be lost unless they are populated as dummy data during table creation)
