//In order to communicate with the DB you'll need to do the following:

// ...create a schema in MySQL Workbench with the name "webshop"
// ...create a user that can access that database that has the username: 'root' and password 'admin'

/* ...Also - a heads-up:
note that at the moment we re-create the tables when we run the backends app.js
(that means all edits will be lost unless they are populated as dummy data during table creation)
*/

//TODO:
/*
- set up associations
- look up summation related code (like total price in cart etc)... The last highly relevant routes
- discuss the naming convention of the urls with the group
*/
